# Canvas
A simple art canvas using React. Built to be used in the [DumBidders](https://github.com/emmettito/DumBidders) game (and any other game that may depend on artistic input).

Short-term goals:

- [ ] Work on "TODO" tasks within the code
- [ ] Improve the poor porting to React
- [ ] Refactor canvas controls to its own component
- [ ] Refactor popovers (and rename to overlay?)
- [ ] Update CSS styles
- [ ] Other refactoring...
- [ ] Add modularization so it can be used in other projects

Long-term goals:

- [ ] Other canvas tools (eg. paint brushes & a ruler)
- [ ] Paint bucket :)
